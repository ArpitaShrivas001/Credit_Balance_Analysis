# Credit_Card_Acitivity
Prediction Modelling using regression to identify key factors affecting credit card activity in a firm

  SUMMARY:
To get a better estimate of its accounts receivable in the form of customer monthly credit
card balances, credit card companies are interested in understanding the key reasons or factors that affect 
the level and frequency of credit card activity.

In order to better provide services to customers and regulate its business operations, data analysis can immensely 
help in taking data drive decsisions. 

GOALS:
Conducted regression modelling using ANOVA to identify below:

key factors that influence credit card activity in this firm 
factors that provide the best estimate of monthly customer credit card balances. 
key factors that influence the observed level of balances. 
five factors that influence credit card balances 

PROJECT FLOW:
1)Identified potential variables by testing prediction models using regression 
2)Evalauted the prediction model - standard error of estimate, coefficient of determination 
3)Checked significance of the model using hypothesis testing 

Tools: ANOVA, Predictive modelling, regression analysis, hypothesis testing,
Type1 errors, collinearity, p-value, R-square, F value
